## 🧭 Overview

UrbanShield is a Flask-based web application deployed on AWS that allows people to submit real-time reports of incidents such as accidents, disasters or safety concerns. The application supports image uploads, geolocation via Google Maps API and structured data storage.

The goal is to help people and authorities — stay informed and connected through transparent public reporting.

| **S3**          | Stores uploaded images securely                         |
| **RDS / MySQL** | Stores incident report data in structured format        |
| **VPC**         | Isolated networking environment for the application     |
| **IAM**         | Manages secure access between EC2 and other services    |
| **CloudFormation** | Automates infrastructure deployment as code          |

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **User submits a report** with location, incident type, details and image(optional).
2. **Google Maps API** fetches coordinates from the address.
3. Image is uploaded to **S3** and metadata is stored in **RDS**.
4. Public can view the reports which are submitted and share it with the respective authority.
